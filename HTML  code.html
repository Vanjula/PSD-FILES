<h2 id="bt"> What is Virtual Reality (VR)? </h2>
</head>

<body bgcolor="lightblue">
<p>Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment.
Virtual Reality’s most immediately-recognizable component is the head-mounted display (HMD). Human beings are visual creatures, and display technology is often the single biggest difference between immersive Virtual Reality systems and traditional user interfaces.
Major players in Virtual Reality include HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR (PSVR)</p>
<p>Virtual reality places the user inside a three-dimensional experience. Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed in and interact with 3D worlds.

Simulation of human senses—all five of them—transforms a computer into a vehicle into new worlds. The only limitation to a superb VR experience is computing power and content</p>

<h2 id="ty">Three Main Types Of Virtual Reality:</h2>
<p>All three types of VR, from non-immersive, semi-immersive, full immersive or a mixture of them, are also referred to as extended reality (XR). Three types of virtual reality experiences provide different levels of computer-generated simulation.</p>
<h3><strong>Three Main Categories are..</strong></h3>
<ul type="square" class="types">
<li class="tp"><strong>Non-Immersive Virtual Reality: </strong></li>
<p>This category is often overlooked as VR simply because it’s so common. Non-immersive VR technology features a computer-generated virtual environment where the user simultaneously remains aware and controlled by their physical environment. Video games are a prime example of non-immersive VR.</p>
<li class="tp"><strong>Semi-Immersive Virtual Reality: </strong></li>
<p>This type of VR provides an experience partially based in a virtual environment. This type of VR makes sense for educational and training purposes with graphical computing and large projector systems, such as flight simulators for pilot trainees.</p>
<li class="tp"><strong>Fully Immersive Virtual Reality: </strong></li>
<p>Right now, there are no completely immersive VR technologies, but advances are so swift that they may be right around the corner. This type of VR generates the most realistic simulation experience, from sight to sound to sometimes even olfactory sensations. Car racing games are an example of immersive virtual reality that gives the user the sensation of speed and driving skills. Developed for gaming and other entertainment purposes, VR use in other sectors is increasing.</p>

<h3 id="wk">How Does Virtual Reality Technology Work?</h3>
<p>The VR process combines hardware and software to create immersive experiences that “fool” the eye and brain. Hardware supports sensory stimulation and simulation such as sounds, touch, smell or heat intensity, while software creates the rendered virtual environment.</p>
<h3>What Technology Does Virtual Reality Use?</h3>
<p>VR technology commonly consists of headsets and accessories such as controllers and motion trackers. Driven by proprietary downloadable apps or web-based VR, the technology is accessible via a web browser.</p>
<h3>What Hardware Does Virtual Reality Use?</h3>
<p>Virtual reality hardware includes sensory accessories such as controllers, as well as headsets, hand trackers, treadmills and, for creators, 3D cameras. </p>
<h3> What Software Does Virtual Reality Use?</h3>
<p> Developers use various software to build VR. They include VR software development kits, visualization software, content management, game engines, social platforms, and training simulators.</p>

<td>* The real world is hidden and the user is completely immersed in a digitl exiperience,creating a digital simulation of a real environment</td>
<td>* The capadilites of AR and VR are blended , bringing together thr physical and digital world to produce an environment where physical and digital objects coexist and interact in real time</td>
